	<p>So a synesthete would experience the letter ‘A’ as red (actually one of the more common synesthesia experiences). Note, this isn’t just imagining or associating the letter ‘A’ with the color red. This is when a person with this ability actually sees every letter ‘A’ as a vivid, clear-as-blood red. They would assume it was you accidentally leaving a highlighted letter in word document, or actually hearing a sharp, tinny sound every time they saw a thin, clear line.This is a pretty cool little psychological fact, but it is taken one step further by the notion of ideasthesia — that one can feel or physically experience an idea. Instead of a letter or a sound or a single word as being physically felt, an entire idea or construct or abstract is experienced phenomenologically.But this seems abstract in and of itself, right? Like, what would it mean to ‘feel’ an idea? The classic example, linked to here, would be to imagine two shapes. One is a curvy splatter, kind of like the old 90s Nickelodeon logo, and the other is an angular, jagged, pointy sort of shape. Which would you call Kiki and which would you call Bouba?
